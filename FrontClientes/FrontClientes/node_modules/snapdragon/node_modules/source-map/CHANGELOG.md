## 0.5.4

* Large performance improvements to source-map serialization. See #228 and #229.

## 0.5.2

## 0.5.0

* Node 0.8 is no longer supported.

* Use webpack instead of dryice for bundling.

* Big speedups serializing source maps. See pull request #203.

* Fix a bug with `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor` and sources that
  explicitly start with the source root. See issue #199.

## 0.4.4

* Fix an issue where using a `SourceMapGenerator` after having created a
  `SourceMapConsumer` from it via `SourceMapConsumer.fromSourceMap` failed. See
  issue #191.

* Fix an issue with where `SourceMapGenerator` would mistakenly consider
  different mappings as duplicates of each other and avoid generating them. See
  issue #192.

## 0.4.3

* A very large number of performance improvements, particularly when parsing
  source maps. Collectively about 75% of time shaved off of the source map
  parsing benchmark!

* Fix a bug in `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor` and fuzzy
  searching in the presence of a column option. See issue #177.

* Fix a bug with joining a source and its source root when the source is above
  the root. See issue #182.

* Add the `SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources` method to
  determine when all sources' contents are inlined into the source map. See
  issue #190.

## 0.4.2

* Add an `.npmignore` file so
